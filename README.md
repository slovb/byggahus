Won the Considition 2020 Hackathon/Competition solving a given problem that requires their backendserver to run so this code is most likely not functional anymore.

Due to the nature of the competition a lot of the executables were duplicated in case small modifications needed to be done for the final competition, especially the mapX.py files change prioritization strategy. Hence it is a mess with a fair number of the files being just for testing theories.
